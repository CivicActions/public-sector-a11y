## Feature Request: Automatic Data Backup Scheduling

	### Problem
	Currently, there is no way for users to schedule automatic backups of their data. This means that users have to manually create backups, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error.

	### Solution
	The goal of this feature request is to add a scheduling feature that would allow users to automatically backup their data at regular intervals. This would save users time and reduce the risk of data loss due to forgotten backups.

	### Benefits
	- Automated backup scheduling
	- Time-saving
	- Reduced risk of data loss

	### Acceptance Criteria
	- Users can schedule automatic backups to run at regular intervals (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly)
	- Users receive notifications when backups are complete
	- Backups can be easily restored by the user
